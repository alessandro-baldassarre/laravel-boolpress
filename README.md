Full stack project that uses Vue.js(Vue Router) as front end framework and Laravel(Eloquent, Blade) as back end framework. The main focus of the project was to implement a replica of any blog focusing mainly on the management part of the model and the controller instead of the view. Implemented registration of new users and login, creation of REST Api to be called up in the front end to view data.
